# Traffic Engineering
This folder contains implementation of `Soroush` for the traffic engineering usecase. Our implementation uses Gurobi v10.0.3 optimization solver as the backend.

## Instructions
We use the topologies and traffic distributions from NCFlow. You can follow the steps in https://github.com/netcontract/ncflow to fetch these two.
